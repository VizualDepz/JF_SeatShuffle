# JF_SeatShuffle

Completely rewritten my old script considering I actually know how to code now and it was littered with bugs

Enjoy!

**HOW TO USE**
As of the current latest version, the player will stay seated in their current seat. Be it, the passenger seat or the driver seat. If you press and hold your sprint button(Lshift[PC], X[PS] or A[XBOX]) it will shuffle you to the neighbouring seat. Alternatively you can type type /shuff to do the same thing

**CHANGELOG**
* 2.0.0
-can now shuffle from both driver and passenger seat.
-added keybind option (sprint key by default)
* 1.0.1
-By default, players will stay seated in the passenger seat. If you type /shuff they shuffle into the driver seat.
* 1.0.0
-First version. By default the player will shuffle into driver seat,  /shuffle enables and disables the script.

**FIXED BUGS**
* Sometimes the player would not shut the door when entering vehicle
* Sometimes the player would start teleporting to the animation of switching seat then teleports back into passenger seat
* Sometimes the door opens would open and close while driving

**KNOWN BUGS**
* Sometimes the door will shut with no player animation
